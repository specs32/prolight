I decided to start a new branch of this project since it gets more and more complex and difficult to manufacture at home.

future versions will get their own folder with all in it so it is easy to find what you need.

Kicad : schematic, board layout, gerber files, etc. 
Blender : STL files for the case
Prolib : software to run on your prolight
